      Landscaping is like painting with plants, rocks, and outdoor elements to 
create awesome backyard vibes. It's all about crafting outdoor spaces that 
are not only beautiful but also chill and relaxing. Think lush gardens, cozy 
seating areas, and maybe even a cool fire pit or two. Basically, it's about 
turning your outdoor area into your own little piece of paradise..
